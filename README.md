# Karnaugh-Map-Minimizer
First iOS app created.

Karnaugh map minimizer app for iOS devices written with Swift 2.0 to simplify boolean algebra expressions. Reduced dynamically created K-maps of up to 6 variables and presented results graphically in tables. Implemented with the Quine-McCluskey algorithm and Petrick's method.

Inspired by my class, CSE 31 - Introduction to Digital Systems.
